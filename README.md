Create a high-resolution vector logo of the word "TiErMoN" in the iconic style of the official Pokémon logo, delivered as a PNG with a transparent background. The entire logo must fit perfectly within the image bounds. The lettering should use the characteristic bold, rounded, and playful font with a bright yellow fill, a thick blue outline, and a subtle 3D drop-shadow effect for depth. The arrangement of the letters is crucial: begin with a large capital 'T', with a smaller lowercase 'i' tucked directly beneath the right side of its horizontal bar. Following this, place a capital 'E' with a smaller lowercase 'r' nestled beside it, maintaining the bouncy and varied-size feel of the original. The final three letters, "M", "o", "N", should precisely replicate the style, capitalization (capital M, lowercase o, capital N), and energetic alignment of the "M o N" from the source logo.
